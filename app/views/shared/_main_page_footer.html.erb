                    <h2 class="section-heading">Our Goal</h2></center>
                    <p class="lead">
                        The aim is to bring the NGO in the eye of those people who wish to bring about a positive change to the society because thatâ€™s the underlying principle of every NGO.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">NGOs work with a strong principle. Every NGO has a different area of concern. Championing the cause of your favourite NGO would help immensely. Spreading the word of their activities and events on Facebook, Twitter & WhatsApp would generate more participation in all their events, which in turn will create a platform perfect for raising more funds. The more vocal you are, the more the efforts of the NGO will get highlighted to the public</p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        The easiest way to make a difference to an organisation you support is to donate to their fundraiser. Takestand provides security to your donations as they go directly to the beneficiaries without any intermediate delays.

                    <p class="lead">Sometimes lending services is all that is required to support NGOs. Volunteering your expertise and time can make the operational tasks of an NGO much easier. The services can be as simple as clerical work, picking up donations, helping to maintain their website, advertising their work on a social media platform, etc.</p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        There is a way that every professional can help. Doctors are invaluable for health camps and blood donations, pro-bono legal services are an excellent way lawyers can be of service, even providing discounts wherever applicable can be of great help for the NGO.
